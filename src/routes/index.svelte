  <h3>Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘€</h3>
  <p>
    I've been having a bad time solving boring and time taking questions in my
    Operating Systems class so I decided to put together a set of tools to help
    me save some time (and hopefully you too!)
  </p>
  <p>Tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="tools/page-replacement">Page Replacement</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="tools/scheduling">Process Scheduling</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
